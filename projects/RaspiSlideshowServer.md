# Background

Recently the James Webb Telescope got launched into Space and since I'm a big Space Nerd, I was really thrilled. In a [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/sgmc4e/i_built_a_james_webb_inspired_bit_of_wall_art/) I saw some amazing wall art mirror Design that I wanted to try for myself. When looking through the comments,  I saw some folks discussing the possibility of putting a Display in the middle Hexagon which is connected to a Raspberry Pi, that pulls the most recent Image of the Telescope and displays it. I really liked the idea and had a spare Raspberry Pi laying around, but the telescope wasn't fully deployed yet so I wanted to have my Raspberry Pi just show a slideshow of Images I put in a certain Folder. Since I don't want to remote connect to the Raspberry Pi everytime I want to change some pictures, I also set up a File Sharing Server with Samba, where I can easily replace files from any computer in my network. In this tutorial I want to explain how I set everything up.

# Photo Slideshow on Raspberry Pi Using Feh

## System Info

The instructions in this tutorial assume a fresh Install of Raspbian using [the official Raspbian imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) 

## Feh Installation and Test

1. Installation of the [feh image viewer program](https://feh.finalrewind.org/). The Raspbian operating system uses the [APT package management](https://embeddedinventor.com/sudo-apt-get-install-command-explained-for-beginners/) so the installation of feh can be done with the following terminal command:

    apt-get install feh

2. Create a folder, where the to be displayed Images will be stored. Either use the desktop interface or create it from the [terminal](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-make-a-folder-in-ubuntu).
